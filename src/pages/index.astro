		<p>I hack on a lot of projects on my spare time, often focusing on one project at a time. A handful of them are listed below, various other can be found on my GitHub account!</p>
		
		<h1 class="text-xl mt-5 mb-3 font-extrabold"> <span class="bg-gray-700 rounded-lg p-1">🧊Packed Ice</span></h1>
		<p>Minecraft was the game that grew me up, and of course i played in a lot of server. But one day i asked myself how do those servers work? How do they interact with the minecraft clients? Then I started coding this project on a memory-efficent minecraft server.</p>
		
		<h1 class="text-xl mt-5 mb-3 font-extrabold"> <span class="bg-gray-700 rounded-lg p-1">🤖FSDM</span></h1>
		<p>This was a cool little project on a Finite State Machine Designer that I had to create for my school. They were using a very old and bad finite state machine designer written in java, so i created them a new one!</p>
